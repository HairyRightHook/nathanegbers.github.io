                <h1>Marie Crawford - Founder & Lead Groomer</h1>
                <p>Marie has always had a passion for dogs, and that love led her to create Winsome Waggers Dog Grooming. With 23 years of experience in the pet care industry, Marie specializes in breed-specific
                    styling, gentle handling techniques, and making every pup feel like royalty. After training at one of the top grooming academies in the country, she dreamed of opening a salon where dogs could feel
                    comfortable, safe, and pampered. Winsome Waggers was born from that dream, built on the belief that every dog deserves a stress-free grooming experience. Marie’s patient approach, combined with her
                    skillful techniques, ensures that even the most anxious pets leave with wagging tails and stylish coats. When she’s not at the salon, you’ll find Marie hiking with her furbaby Winston, or volunteering
                    at the local animal rescue.</p>

                <h1>Charli Furman - Professional Groomer</h1>
                <p>Charli brings energy, creativity, and expert grooming skills to Winsome Waggers. With a background in pet care and a deep love for animals, Charli specializes in precision cuts,
                    playful styling, and ensuring every dog gets the perfect look to match their personality. Known for her friendly and calming presence, Charli is especially skilled at working with nervous or
                    first-time pups, helping them feel at ease throughout the grooming process. She believes that grooming isn’t just about appearances—it’s about keeping dogs happy, healthy, and comfortable. Outside of
                    the salon, Charli loves training her rescue pup, Milo, and discovering new dog-friendly cafes around town.</p>
